# Tinker - Invoice Approval System

A modern invoice approval system built with Hono, Drizzle ORM, better-auth, and TypeScript. This documentation provides comprehensive guides for implementing a type-safe, high-performance invoice approval system with business process tracking.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete software analysis and implementation approach, from domain modeling through technical implementation. The system handles invoice processing, payment request workflows, multi-stage approvals, and comprehensive business process tracking.

## Key Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Hono.js + Drizzle ORM + better-auth + SQLite
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with full type inference
- **Authentication**: Username/password + Google OAuth integration
- **Business Intelligence**: 15 indexed processes with 150 specific error codes
- **Rich Documentation**: Comprehensive guides with mermaid diagrams

## Analysis Workflow

The project follows a systematic approach to software analysis and implementation:

1. **Event Storming** - Discover domain events and state changes of database entities
2. **User Journey Mapping** - Build and confirm user workflows, verify against event storming
3. **Information Architecture** - Extract touch points and build navigation structure
4. **Screen Mockups** - Create realistic, clickable prototypes for key user paths
5. **Technical Implementation** - Modern tech stack with comprehensive documentation

## System Overview

### Business Context

The Tinker invoice approval system handles the complete lifecycle of invoice processing:

**Invoice Processing Flow:**
1. **Import** - Invoices imported in batches (manual/automatic)
2. **Queue** - Invoices queued for processing by admin/HR
3. **Payment Request Creation** - Admin/HR creates Payment Requests (PRs) 
4. **Approval Workflow** - Multi-stage approval process with back-and-forth capability
5. **Payment Processing** - Finance handles external payments
6. **Completion** - Finance marks PRs as completed, sealing the process

### Key Entities

- **Invoices** - Individual invoice records with import/obsolete status
- **Payment Requests (PRs)** - Working units containing grouped invoices with approval workflow
- **Users** - Different roles: Invoice Processor, PR Creator, Approver, Finance Officer, Admin
- **Approval History** - Complete audit trail of approval decisions and comments

### Technical Implementation

The system is built with modern web technologies focusing on:
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript implementation with Drizzle ORM
- **Performance** - Hono.js for ultrafast API responses
- **Authentication** - better-auth with OAuth and traditional login
- **Business Intelligence** - Comprehensive error tracking and process monitoring

## Getting Started

1. **Start with Domain Analysis** - Review the [Event Storming](./1_event_storming.md) documentation
2. **Understand the Architecture** - Check the [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md) guide
3. **Set up Development** - Follow the [Development Setup](./development-setup.md) instructions
4. **Implement Database** - Use the [Database Implementation](./database-implementation.md) plan

## Next Steps

This documentation provides the foundation for implementing a production-ready invoice approval system. Each guide includes detailed implementation steps, code examples, and architectural decisions to ensure a successful deployment.
