Event Storming is a workshop-based method to quickly explore complex business domains. It focuses on domain events, commands that trigger them, aggregates that encapsulate related data and behavior, and the policies that govern the system. Domain Events Timeline \u00b6 Below is a timeline of the key domain events in the invoice approval system, from invoice import to completion. graph LR classDef event fill:#FFD700,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px; classDef command fill:#4169E1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white; classDef aggregate fill:#32CD32,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px; classDef policy fill:#FF6347,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px; classDef external fill:#D3D3D3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px; C1[Import Invoices] -->|triggers| E1[Invoices Imported] E1 -->|updates| A1[Invoice] C2[Create Payment Request] -->|triggers| E2[Payment Request Created] E2 -->|updates| A2[Payment Request] C3[Link Invoices to PR] -->|triggers| E3[Invoices Linked to PR] E3 -->|updates| A1 & A2 C4[Submit for Approval] -->|triggers| E4[PR Submitted for Approval] E4 -->|updates| A2 C5[Review PR] -->|triggers| E5[PR Reviewed] E5 -->|may trigger| C6[Request Changes] C6 -->|triggers| E6[Changes Requested] E6 -->|updates| A2 C7[Make Changes] -->|triggers| E7[PR Updated] E7 -->|updates| A2 C8[Approve PR] -->|triggers| E8[PR Approved] E8 -->|updates| A2 P1[Approval Policy] -->|governs| C8 C9[Make Payment] -->|triggers| E9[Payment Made] E9 -->|external| EX1[External Payment System] C10[Mark PR as Completed] -->|triggers| E10[PR Completed] E10 -->|updates| A2 E10 -->|triggers| E11[Invoices Marked as Completed] E11 -->|updates| A1 C11[Revert PR] -->|triggers| E12[PR Reverted] E12 -->|updates| A2 class E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11,E12 event; class C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10,C11 command; class A1,A2 aggregate; class P1 policy; class EX1 external; Key Domain Events \u00b6 Invoices Imported : Batches of invoices are imported into the system. Payment Request Created : Admin or HR creates a payment request. Invoices Linked to PR : One or more invoices are linked to a payment request. PR Submitted for Approval : The payment request is submitted for approval. PR Reviewed : The payment request is reviewed by an approver. Changes Requested : Reviewer requests changes to the payment request. PR Updated : Changes are made to the payment request. PR Approved : The payment request is approved (possibly through multiple stages). Payment Made : Payment is made outside the system. PR Completed : Finance marks the payment request as completed. Invoices Marked as Completed : Linked invoices are marked as completed. PR Reverted : Payment request is reverted to a previous state if needed. Commands \u00b6 Commands are actions that trigger domain events: Import Invoices : User imports a batch of invoices. Create Payment Request : Admin/HR creates a new payment request. Link Invoices to PR : User links invoices to a payment request. Submit for Approval : User submits a payment request for approval. Review PR : Approver reviews a payment request. Request Changes : Approver requests changes to a payment request. Make Changes : User makes changes to a payment request. Approve PR : Approver approves a payment request. Make Payment : Finance makes payment (external to the system). Mark PR as Completed : Finance marks a payment request as completed. Revert PR : Admin reverts a payment request to a previous state. Aggregates \u00b6 Aggregates are clusters of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit: Invoice : Represents an invoice in the system. Properties: ID, Amount, Date, Vendor, Status (Imported, Linked, Completed, Obsolete) Behaviors: Link to PR, Mark as Completed, Mark as Obsolete Payment Request : Represents a payment request in the system. Properties: ID, Total Amount, Date, Status (Draft, In Review, Approved, Completed), Linked Invoices, Approval History Behaviors: Link Invoices, Submit for Approval, Update, Approve, Complete, Revert Policies \u00b6 Policies are business rules that govern the system: Approval Policy : Determines the approval workflow for a payment request. Different payment requests may have different approval routes. May include multiple approval stages. May include rules based on amount thresholds, departments, etc. External Systems \u00b6 External Payment System : The system where actual payments are processed (outside the scope of this system). State Changes \u00b6 Invoice States \u00b6 Imported : Initial state when an invoice is imported into the system. Linked : Invoice is linked to a payment request. Completed : Invoice is marked as completed after the linked payment request is completed. Obsolete : Invoice is marked as obsolete (no longer valid). Payment Request States \u00b6 Draft : Initial state when a payment request is created. In Review : Payment request is submitted for approval and under review. Approved : Payment request has been approved. Completed : Payment has been made and the payment request is marked as completed. Hotspots and Questions \u00b6 During the Event Storming analysis, several hotspots (areas of uncertainty or complexity) were identified: Approval Workflow Complexity : How complex can the approval workflows be? Can they be dynamic based on certain criteria? Reverting Completed PRs : What are the business rules for reverting a completed payment request? Partial Payments : Is it possible to make partial payments against a payment request? Batch Processing : How are batches of invoices handled? Are there any special considerations? Audit Requirements : What audit trail is required for compliance purposes? Conclusion \u00b6 This Event Storming analysis provides a high-level overview of the invoice approval system domain. It identifies the key events, commands, aggregates, and policies that govern the system. This analysis will serve as a foundation for the subsequent user journey mapping and screen design.","title":"Event Storming"},{"location":"1_event_storming/#event-storming-analysis-invoice-approval-system","text":"","title":"Event Storming Analysis: Invoice Approval System"},{"location":"1_event_storming/#introduction","text":"This document presents an Event Storming analysis of the invoice approval system.

It provides an overview of all documentation artifacts, their purpose, and how they interconnect to form a complete picture of the system. Documentation Structure \u00b6 The documentation follows a 5-step workflow designed to progressively build understanding from core business processes to detailed UI specifications: Event Storming - Identifying key domain events and state changes User Journeys - Mapping complete user paths through the system Touch Points & Screens - Listing all UI interaction points Screen Mockups - Detailed UI designs for each screen Screen Variations - States, transitions, and navigation between screens Document Overview \u00b6 1. Event Storming ( 1_event_storming.md ) \u00b6 Purpose: Identify the core domain events, commands, and state changes in the system. Key Components: Domain Events (orange): Key business events that occur in the system Commands (blue): User actions that trigger events Aggregates (yellow): Core business entities that change state Policies (purple): Business rules that react to events External Systems (pink): Integration points outside the system Main Flows Identified: Invoice Import Process Payment Request Creation Approval Workflow Payment Completion Process How to Use This Document: Reference for understanding the core business processes Foundation for identifying system states and transitions Guide for validating that all key business events are addressed in the UI 2. User Journeys ( 2_user_journeys.md ) \u00b6 Purpose: Map complete paths users take through the system to accomplish goals. Key User Types: Regular Users (Invoice Importers) Administrators/HR (Payment Request Creators) Approvers (Various Levels) Finance Team Members Primary Journeys Documented: Invoice Import Journey Payment Request Creation Journey Approval Journey Payment Completion Journey How to Use This Document: Validate that the UI supports all required user journeys Identify potential friction points in user workflows Ensure all user types have appropriate paths through the system 3. Touch Points & Screens ( 3_touch_points_screens.md ) \u00b6 Purpose: Enumerate all screens and interaction points needed to support user journeys. Screen Categories: Dashboard Screens Invoice Management Screens Payment Request Screens Approval Screens User Management Screens Key Interactions Identified: Data Entry Points Decision Points Notification Points Transition Points How to Use This Document: Checklist to ensure all necessary screens are designed Reference for understanding the scope of the UI Guide for identifying screen relationships 4. Screen Mockups ( 4_screen_mockups.md ) \u00b6 Purpose: Provide detailed UI designs for each screen identified. Design Elements: Layout Specifications Component Descriptions Data Display Formats Input Controls Navigation Elements How to Use This Document: Visual reference for UI implementation Guide for understanding information hierarchy Specification for UI component requirements 5. Screen Variations ( 5_screen_variations.md ) \u00b6 Purpose: Document different states, variations, and navigation paths between screens. Key Aspects: Screen States (loading, empty, error, etc.) Role-based Variations Transition Paths Conditional Logic Business Rules Implementation How to Use This Document: Reference for implementing dynamic UI behavior Guide for handling different user roles and permissions Specification for screen transitions and navigation Cross-Cutting Concerns \u00b6 Throughout all documents, several cross-cutting concerns are addressed: User Roles and Permissions \u00b6 Regular Users: Import invoices, view status Administrators/HR: Create and manage Payment Requests Approvers: Review and approve/reject Payment Requests Finance Team: Mark payments as completed, finalize records System States \u00b6 Draft: Initial creation, editable Submitted: In workflow, limited editing In Review: Under approval consideration Approved: Passed all approvals Completed: Fully processed and sealed Rejected: Returned for modification Business Rules \u00b6 Invoice linking requirements Approval routing based on amount thresholds Sequential vs. parallel approval workflows Completion and sealing requirements How to Use This Documentation \u00b6 For Product Managers \u00b6 Start with Event Storming to understand the business domain Review User Journeys to validate user workflows Use Touch Points & Screens to verify scope completeness Reference Screen Mockups and Variations for detailed requirements For Designers \u00b6 Begin with User Journeys to understand user needs Use Touch Points & Screens as a design checklist Implement designs based on Screen Mockups Incorporate states and variations from Screen Variations For Developers \u00b6 Understand the domain model from Event Storming Reference User Journeys for workflow implementation Use Screen Mockups as UI implementation guides Implement dynamic behavior based on Screen Variations Next Steps \u00b6 To move from documentation to implementation: Technical Architecture Design Define system architecture Select appropriate technologies Design data models based on domain entities Development Planning Break down into implementable features Prioritize development sequence Establish development milestones UI Implementation Develop component library Implement screen designs Build navigation and transitions Business Logic Implementation Implement domain events and commands Build approval workflows Create business rule validations Testing and Validation Verify user journeys function as expected Validate business rules are correctly enforced Test screen variations and states Conclusion \u00b6 This documentation set provides a comprehensive blueprint for the Invoice Approval System, focusing on user experience and business processes rather than technical implementation details. By following the progressive workflow from Event Storming to Screen Variations, we've created a complete picture of the system from multiple perspectives. The documentation is designed to be accessible to all stakeholders while providing sufficient detail for implementation. By starting with business processes and user needs before moving to UI specifics, we ensure the system will meet business requirements while providing an excellent user experience.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"6_summary/#invoice-approval-system-documentation-summary","text":"This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the Invoice Approval System documentation created through our structured workflow.
